# dynamic-knn-gpu
GPU based Dynamic k-Nearest Neighbours - A simple but flexible k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm using TensorFlow with GPU support. The algorithm was designed to work with dynamic attributes such as the number of k neighbours, for each prediction. Achieved a 50x speedup on problems where the neighbourhood size and other model attributes are dynamic for each instance, when compared to other popular implementations, such as the one from Scikit-Learn. In cases where the model attributes are static, other implementations with a fit step are better suited.
